Identify and understand the Business Needs.\n\na) Determine the long-term goal of the product (i.e., good or service) and write it down.\nThe long-term goal of mastering voronoi treemap is to increase efficiency (through automation) and effectiveness of access to knowledge.\n\n\nb) Answer the question “Why are we doing this project?”\nThe reason for mastering voronoi treemap is to increase efficiency (through automation) and effectiveness of access to knowledge.\n\n\nc) Identify the success criteria that will indicate whether or not the product (i.e., good or service) is successful.\nIf you master something, you learn how to do it properly or you succeed in understanding it completely.\nHence, mastering voronoi treemap has been successful if we either learn how to do it properly or we succeed in understanding it completely."
